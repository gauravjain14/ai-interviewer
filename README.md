# AI Interviewer prototype

A lightweight static page inspired by Claude's interviewer experience. It highlights multiple interview topics and shows the opening prompt, first question, and response box when a topic is selected.

## Running locally

This project is fully static—no build step is required.

```bash
# from the repo root
python -m http.server 3000
# then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

You can deploy the contents of the repository to any static host (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
